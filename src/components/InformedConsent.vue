        <p><strong> Why we are doing this research: </strong>
          The goal of this project is to collect data on the impact of an AI on human decision-making, using profession
          identification
          via a short resume written in English.
        </p>
        <p><strong> What you will have to do: </strong>
          After filling out demographic information, we will provide you instructions on the first part of this study.
          In this, you will decide which of the five given professions the person to whom the resume belongs is most
          likely to have.
          In total, you will be presented with 10 examples.
          After that, you will receive instructions for the second part of the study.
          Here you do the same as in the first part, except that now you are supported in your decision-making by our
          AI.
          The second part consists of 20 examples.
        </p>
        <p><strong> What you will get out of it: </strong>
          You will see how you perform and how gender biased you are compared to our AI and other LabintheWild users.
        </p>
        <p><strong> Are there any risks: </strong>
          We do not anticipate any risks. You can always choose to leave this study by
